        <h1>About Found Items</h1>

        <p>Welcome to our Lost and Found platform, dedicated to reuniting lost items with their rightful owners. The "Found" section plays a crucial role in helping items find their way back home. Here's what you need to know:</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to create a centralized hub for found items, making it easy for individuals to report and discover lost belongings. We believe in fostering a community that values honesty, compassion, and the joy of reuniting people with their cherished possessions.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Found an item? Great! Here's how you can contribute to the community:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Report:</strong> Use our simple reporting form to provide details about the found item.</li>
            <li><strong>Upload:</strong> Attach images or additional information to help identify the item.</li>
            <li><strong>Connect:</strong> Allow owners to reach out to you through our secure messaging system.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Safety First</h2>
        <p>While our platform facilitates the return of lost items, we want to emphasize the importance of safety:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meet in Public Places:</strong> If a meetup is required to return an item, choose a safe and public location.</li>
            <li><strong>Bring a Friend:</strong> If you must meet someone, consider bringing a friend or family member along.</li>
            <li><strong>Inform Others:</strong> Let someone know about your plans, including the time and location of the meetup.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Private Spaces:</strong> Never invite strangers or go to private spaces for exchanges.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Authorities:</strong> If you feel uneasy or encounter suspicious behavior, contact local authorities immediately.</li>
        </ul>
